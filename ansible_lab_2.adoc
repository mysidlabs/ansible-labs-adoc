+
Populate the _New Project_ form with the following information:
+
.. *Name* - `siduser\#\##-repo` where \### is replaced with your user number.
.. *Organization* - `sid-org`
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure  *`sid-org`* is the organization used for all of the excercises in these labs.
====
+
.. *SCM Type* - `git` - this project will be using the lab repository that was forked as a pre-req to this lab.
.. *SCM URL* - use the https version of the git url. *e.g.* `https://github.com/demo-user/ansible-labs.git`
.. *SCM Update Options* - Select the following options:
** Clean
** Delete on Update
** Update Revision on Launch
.. Click the image:icons/save-button.png[] button - your newly created project will be added to the project list at the bottom of the page.
+
image::lab2_000004_project_form.png[]
+
//Create Inventory
. *Create an Inventory*
+ 
In this step, we will configure a dynamic inventory  by leveraging the Amazon Web Services api together with the judicious use of ec2 host tags.
+
.. Begin by navigating to the _Inventories_ page and create a new inventory by clicking the image:icons/new.png[] icon.
+
image::lab2_000005_new_inventory.png[]
+
.. Populate the _New Inventory_ form with the following details:
+
* *Name* - `siduser\#\##-inventory` where \### is replaced with your user number.
* *Organization* - `sid-org`
+
.. Click the image:icons/save-button.png[] button. - your newly created inventory will be added to the inventory list at the bottom of the page.
+
image::lab2_000006_new_inventory_form.png[]
+
// Inventory Source
. *Configure an Inventory Source*
+
In this step we will configure a source for the newly defined inventory.
+
.. Click the image:icons/sources-button.png[] button/tab and then click the image:icons/new.png[] icon to open the source creation form.
+
image::lab2_000007_new_inventory_source.png[]
+
.. Populate the _Inventory Source_ form with the following details:
* *Name* - `siduser\#\##-aws-source` where \### is replaced with your user number.
* *Source* - select `Amazon EC2` from the option list.
This will cascade-populate the Credential box with valid credential options for the selected source.
* *Credential* - click the image:icons/search.png[] icon and then select `aws-api` from the resulting pop-up.
* *Regions* - Select `US East (Ohio)`
* *Instance Filters* - _verbatim_ `tag:mysidlabs_owner=siduser###`
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Please doublecheck the _Regions_ and _Instance Filters_ values, as both fields are *critical* for the deployment and clean-up of the lab infrastructure.
====
+
* *Only Group By* - select `Tags`
* *Update Options* - Select:
** Overwrite
** Update on Launch
.. Click the image:icons/save-button.png[] button and the source will be added to the sources list at the bottom of the page.
+
image::lab2_000008_source_form.png[]
+

// Create Job Template
. *Create and Configure the _Create_ Job Template*
+
In this portion of the lab, we will be creating _Job Templates_ to represent the Ansible plays in the lab repository. We'll begin with creating a _Job Template_ for the _create.yaml_ play in the lab2 folder.
+
.. Click the image:icons/new.png[] icon and select _Job Template_ as the template type from the initial pop-up.
.. Populate the _New Job Template_ fields with the following values:
* *Name*: use `siduser\#\##-create`,  where \### is replaced with your user number.
* *Job Type*: `Run`
* *Inventory*: `localhost-inventory`.
+
[NOTE]
====
In Ansible, when connecting to an external API, especially in the creation of infrastructure, the play is run and executed on the localhost.  `localhost-inventory` represents the _Tower_ localhost when running plays such as this.
====
* *Project*: `siduser\#\##-repo` where \### is replaced with your user number.
* *PlaybooK*: `lab2/create.yaml`
* *Credentials*: Click image:icons/search.png[] in the _Credentials_ field, select `Amazon Web Services` for the _Credential Type_, and then select `aws-api` and then click image:icons/select-button.png[]
+

+
image::lab2_create_template_form.png[]
+
.. Click the image:icons/save-button.png[] button to save the template.
.. Click the image:icons/launch-button.png[] button to execute the job.
* when the job has completed review the output at the bottom of the page.
+
image::lab2_create_job_output.png[]
+
* Review the output from the run and make a note of the public IP Address that was generated for the load-balancer, `***-lb-0 == Private IP: ..., Public IP: ..."`.
This will be the public endpoint for our web-application once it has been configured.
+
[NOTE]
====
The output in Tower is the same output that would be generated by the CLI with the `ansible-playbook` command.
====
.. The _Create_ play that was just executed created three new EC2 hosts.  We can now view these hosts in the dynamic inventory we created earlier in the lab.
* Navigate to the inventory for your lab user  `Inventory -> siduser\###-inventory` and then click on the `SOURCES` button, click the `SYNC-ALL` button.  Then click on the `HOSTS` button.
It should look similar to the following:
+
image::lab2_dynamic_inventory.png[]
+

+

// Configure Job Template
. *Create and Configure the _Configure_ Job Template*
+
We'll now create the _Job Template_ for the _configure.yaml_ play from lab2.  This process is very similar to the previous step with the exception that this time we will specify our user _dynamic_ inventory.
+
.. Click the image:icons/new.png[] icon and select _Job Template_ from the pop-up.
.. Populate the _New Job Template_ fields with the following values:
* *Name*: use `siduser\#\##-configure`,  where \### is replaced with your user number.
* *Job Type*: `Run`
* *Inventory*: `siduser\#\##-inventory`  where \### is replaced with your user number.
* *Project*: `siduser\#\##-repo` where \### is replaced with your user number.
* *PlaybooK*: `lab2/configure.yaml`
* *Credentials*: Click image:icons/search.png[] in the _Credentials_ field and then choose `Machine` for the _Credential Type_ and then select `ansible-labs-only` and then click icon:select-button[]
* *Verbosity*: You can modify the verbosity of the output here. `0(Normal)` is the default.

image::lab2_configure_job_log_output.png[]
+
.. Once the job has finished, open a web browser and navigate to the IP address for the load balancer for your application and you should see output to the following.
The application simply toggles back and forth between the two backend apache servers behind the nginx load-balancer.
+
image::lab2_web_app.png[]
+

// Clean Job Template
. *Create and Configure the Clean Job Template*
+
The final step of the lab 2 is to create the _clean.yaml_ template and then run the job which will decommision the infrastructure we spun up during the create play.
+
.. Click the image:icons/new.png[] icon and select _Job Template_ as the template type from the initial pop-up.
.. Populate the _New Job Template_ fields with the following values:
* *Name*: use `siduser\#\##-clean`,  where \### is replaced with your user number.
* *Job Type*: `Run`
* *Inventory*: `localhost-inventory`.
* *Project*: `siduser\#\##-repo` where \### is replaced with your user number.
* *PlaybooK*: `lab2/clean.yaml`
* *Credentials*: Click image:icons/search.png[] in the _Credentials_ field and then choose `Amazon Web Services` for the _Credential Type_ and then select `aws-api` and then click icon:select-button[]
