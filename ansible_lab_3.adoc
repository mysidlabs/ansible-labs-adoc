= Ansible Lab 3 - Introduction to Ansible Tower Workflows
== Overview
Lab 3 introduces _Ansible Tower_ template workflows. In this excerxise you will 

. Create the _wait_for_ssh_ auxillary job template.
. Create a workflow template that combines the plays from the previous lab into a single, executable job run.

== Ansible Tower Workflow Editor Overview
. Ansible tower provides a graphical UI to aid in the creation automation workflows.  
Below is an example of the workflow you will be creating throught the course of this lab. 
+
image::lab3_workflow_vis_overview.png[]
+
. The active node is indicated by a vertical blue bar displayed on the left side of the currently selected node.
Select a node by clicking on it.

* The selected node-type is determined by the drop-down in the upper right corner of the view.
It can be set to one of the following by using the drop down in the top right corner of the view.
*** Template
*** Project Sync
*** Inventory Sync
*** Approval
* The right side-bar will be populated with objects of the type selected in the drop down.
* Selecting an object and clicking the image:icons/select-button.png[] button will assign that object to the current node.
+
image::lab3_workflow_node_detail.png[]
+
* image:icons/node-type.png[] - This icon represents the node type.

* image:icons/node-new.png[] - The plus icon initiates a new node in sequence directly following the currently selected node.

* image:icons/node-link.png[] - The link icon allows this node to be linked to another, already existent, node on the page.
This can be useful in creating paralell execution paths.
* image:icons/node-delete.png[] - The X icon will delete the node after a cocnfirmation.



== Lab 3 - Ansible Tower Workflow
// Create wait_for_ssh template.
To begin the lab:

* Log into https://tower.mysidlabs.com[tower]  (tower.mysidlabs.com)
* Navigate to the _Templates_ page.

We need to create one more _Job Template_, _wait_for_ssh_ before we can piece together the complete workflow for this lab.
[NOTE]
====
When Ansible Tower executes a workflow, the plays are run in sequence without pause.
As a result, it is likely that the _Configure_ step of the workflow will attempt to run before the OS on the newly provisioned machine has had time to start the ssh daemon. 
In order to prevent the run from failing from a connection error, the _wait-for-ssh_ play introduces a polling pause that checks for ssh connectivity before continuing with the configuration play.
====

. Create the _wait-for-ssh_ template by navigating to the _Templates_ page and click the image:icons/new.png[] button.
Populate the form with the following details:
+
* *Name*: `siduser\#\##-wait-for-ssh` where \### is replaced with your user number.
* *Job Type*: `Run`
* *Inventory*: `siduser\#\##-inventory` where \### is replaced with your usser number.
* *Project*: `siduser\#\##-repo` where \### is replaced with your usser number.
* *Playbook*: `lab2/wait_for_ssh.yml`
* *Credentials*: `ansible-labs-only`
* *Extra Variables*: In the extra variable field, please add the following, verbatim:
+
`siduser: "{{ tower_user_name}}"`
+

+

// Create Workflow Template
. Next create the Lab 3 Workflow Template

.. Click the image:icons/new.png[] button to create a new template, this time selecting *_Workflow Template_* from the pop-up.
.. Populate the _New Workflow Job Template_ with the following details:
+
* *Name*: `siduser\###-lab3-workflow`
* *Organization*: `sid-org`
* *Inventory*: `siduser\###-inventory`
+
image::lab3_001_new_workflow_template.png[]
+
* Click the image:icons/save-button.png[] button and then launch the _Workflow Visualizer_.
+
. We will now use the workflow visualizer to compose a single workflow to deploy and configure the sample multi-tier web-app.
+
.. Click on the image:icons/workflow-visualizer-button.png[] button to open the visual editor.
Once the editor is open:
.. Click on the *_Start_* node. A grey dotted outline will appear representing the node to be inserted.
* Select _Project Syn_ from the node-type drop-down.
* Select the project for your user, e.g. siduser270-repo.
* Click the imgae:icons/select-button.png[] to add the node to the workflow.
+
image:lab3_workflow_node1_project_refresh.png[]
+
.. Click on the *_Start_* node again. A second, tentative, node will be displayed underneath the _Project_ node that was just created.
For this node, select the following:
* Select *_Template_* for the node-type.
* Select the `siduser\###-lab2-clean` template from the template list.
* Click the image:icons/select-button.png[] to insert the node.
+
image:lab3_workflow_node2_clean.png[]
+
.. This time mouse over the _lab2-clean_ node just created and click on the image:icons/node-new.png[] button to initiate a new node for the _lab2_create_ job. An extension appears from the _lab2-clean_ node.

* Select `Template` for the node-type.
* Select the `siduser\###-lab2-create` for the job template.
* For this node, make sure tha `On Success` is selected for _RUN_.
* Click the image:icons/select-button.png[] button to add the node to the workflow.

[NOTE]
====
A link type can be determined and edited by hovering the mouse over the link.
image:lab3_workflow_link_mouseover.png[]
Additionally, the links are color-coded as follows:

* [red]*Red* - On Failure
* [green]*Green* - On Success
* [blue]*Blue* - Always
====
+
.. We'll now link the _Project Refresh_ node we created to the new _lab2_create_ node as well.
* Mouseover the _Project Refresh_ node and click the image:icons/node-link.png[] button.
* Now click on the _lab2_create_ node.
* In the righ-hand side-bar make sure that _On Success_ is selected for _RUN_.
* Click the image:icons/save-button.png[] button.
+ 
image:lab3_workflow_link_refresh_and_create.png[]
+
.. We'll now add the _lab2_configure_  node after the _lab2_create_ node.
* Mouseover the _lab2_create_ node and click on the image:icons/node-new.png[] button.
* Select `Template` for the node-type.
* Select `siduser\###-lab2-configure` for the job template.
* Make sure `On Success` is selected for _RUN_.
* Click the image:icons/select-button.png[] button to add the node to the workflow.
+
image:lab3_workflow_node4_configure.png[]
+
.. The _wait_for_ssh_ play is still required in order for this play to run successfully.
This play should be executed after _create_ but before _configure_.
Rather than delete the _configure_ node and then recreating it after the _wait_for_ssh_ play, we can insert a new node into the current workflow.
* Mouse over the linke between the _Create_ and _Configure_ node and click on the image:icons/node-new.png[]
+
image:lab3_insert_link_mouseover.png[]
+
* Select `Template` for the node-type.
* Select `siduser\###-lab2-wait` for the job template.
* Make sure `On Success` is selected for _RUN_.
* Click the image:icons/select-button.png[] button to add the node to the workflow.

+

* Click the image:icons/save-button.png[] button and luanch the workflow.
